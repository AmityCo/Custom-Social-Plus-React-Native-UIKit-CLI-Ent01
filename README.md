## Getting started

Our AmityUIKit include user interfaces to enable fast integration of standard Amity Social features into new or existing applications. Furthermore, our React Native UIKit supports integration with **React Native CLI**, providing you with a flexible experience to seamlessly integrate social features into your existing React Native application.

#Minimum Requirements

- node 20.19.4
- JDK 17.0.10
- ruby 3.2.0
- XCode 15

## Migrating from 4.x.x-RC (Release Candidate)

This release is a major upgrade (React Native 0.82, React 19, Android SDK 36, new peer dependencies). Host-app engineers should follow [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for the full guide before bumping the package.

### Try Sample app

This repository also includes a built-in sample app which you can use to test your code while customizing it, or even explore our UIKit features with just a few installations!

#### Run sample app with Native module

Use yarn

1. Install packages

```
cd example
```

```
yarn
```

2. Sample app is using firebase push notification. you need to setup firebase project by your own firebase project to get credentials.

- Setup firebase project: https://console.firebase.google.com/ for react native android and ios.
- Download google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist.
- Copy and paste to /example/android/app/google-services.json and /example/ios/GoogleService-Info.plist.
- More detail about push notification - https://docs.amity.co/amity-uikit/uikit-v4-beta/installation-guide/react-native#push-notification

3. Configure your apiKey,apiRegion,apiEndpoint,userId,displayName,fcmToken in /example/src/App.tsx file(https://github.com/AmityCo/Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource/blob/main/example/src/App.tsx) first before run the sample app.

   <img width="658" alt="Screenshot 2567-06-12 at 01 52 46" src="https://github.com/AmityCo/Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource/assets/155952277/a312a7db-d790-4af6-9db7-bf085888cd01">

4. Go back to your root folder (`cd ..`) and Choose to run between iOS or Android
5. Install modules and sync file

```sh
yarn
```

6. Run sample app

```sh
yarn example ios
```

or

```
yarn example android
```

### Installation

Here are the steps to install ui-kit together with another React Native project.

```sh
1. git clone https://github.com/AmityCo/Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource.git
2. cd Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource
3. yarn or npm install
4. npm pack
```

This step will build the package and return an `amityco-react-native-social-uikit-x.x.x.tgz` file inside the folder.

Then, inside another project, copy the `.tgz` file to your application folder where you need to use ui-kit and install it:

```sh
yarn add ./amityco-react-native-social-uikit-x.x.x.tgz
```

Next, install the required peer dependencies. These are the packages the UIKit imports at runtime, so they must exist in your app:

```sh
yarn add \
  @amityco/ts-sdk-react-native \
  @babel/plugin-transform-export-namespace-from \
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage \
  @react-native-clipboard/clipboard \
  @react-native-community/datetimepicker \
  @react-native-community/netinfo \
  @react-navigation/native \
  @react-navigation/native-stack \
  @react-navigation/stack \
  react-native-compressor \
  react-native-fs \
  react-native-get-random-values \
  react-native-haptic-feedback \
  react-native-image-picker \
  react-native-linear-gradient \
  react-native-modalbox \
  react-native-safe-area-context \
  react-native-screens \
  react-native-svg \
  react-native-swipe-gestures \
  react-native-video \
  react-native-video-controls
```

> **Versions:** most packages above are unpinned — the exact version range required for each is defined in this package's `peerDependencies` (in its `package.json`), and your package manager will resolve a compatible version from there.
>
> **Livestream & Story features removed.** This build no longer includes the Livestream and Story features, so the LiveKit (`@livekit/react-native`, `@livekit/react-native-webrtc`, `livekit-client`) and `react-native-vision-camera` dependencies are no longer required. This significantly reduces the final app size. All other features — image/video posts, avatars, etc. — are unaffected.

> **Optional — push notifications.** The UIKit accepts an `fcmToken` prop and registers it for push, but it does not depend on Firebase directly. Only install these if your app wants push notifications:
>
> ```sh
> yarn add @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/messaging
> ```

### Babel Config

```sh
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    '@babel/plugin-transform-export-namespace-from',
  ],
};
```

### iOS Configuration

In Pod file, add these lines under your target,

```
  pod 'SPTPersistentCache', :modular_headers => true
  pod 'DVAssetLoaderDelegate', :modular_headers => true
  $RNVideoUseVideoCaching = true
```

<img width="610" alt="Update Pod File" src="https://github.com/AmityCo/Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource/assets/155952277/40117769-4dee-4506-8b4c-703769fa7f2a">

In XCode,

Set `Minimum Deployments  at least iOS 12.0`

<img width="833" alt="Minimum Deployments  at least iOS 12.0" src="https://github.com/AmityCo/Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource/assets/155952277/eb87497c-52ce-4e91-a3ad-f46077724378">

```sh
npx pod-install

```

### Android Configuration

Build project gradle with your Android Studio

In android/build.gradle, add belows in in buildscript > ext

kotlinVersion = 1.7.0 and above
compileSdkVersion = 34
buildToolsVersion = "34.0.0"

<img width="754" alt="Screenshot 2567-06-14 at 19 01 13" src="https://github.com/AmityCo/Amity-Social-UIKit-React-Native-CLI-OpenSource/assets/155952277/82f15d39-8fb0-4b98-b0ec-1dea49a093cf">

### Add Camera permission (iOS)

Add following permissions to `info.plist` file (ios/{YourAppName}/Info.plist). These are used for taking photos and selecting images (posts and profile avatars):

```sh
 <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
 <string>App needs access to the camera to take photos.</string>
 <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
 <string>App needs access to the gallery to select photos.</string>
```

### Add Camera permission (Android)

Add following permission to `AndroidManifest.xml` file (android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

### Usage

```js
import * as React from 'react';

import {
  AmityUiKitSocial,
  AmityUiKitProvider,
} from 'amity-react-native-social-ui-kit';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AmityUiKitProvider
      apiKey="API_KEY"
      apiRegion="API_REGION"
      userId="userId"
      // displayName is optional. If omitted, the user's existing display name
      // is preserved (it is NOT overwritten with the userId). New users can set
      // their display name later via the Create Profile page.
      displayName="displayName"
      apiEndpoint="https://api.{API_REGION}.amity.co"
    >
      <AmityUiKitSocial />
    </AmityUiKitProvider>
  );
}
```

## Using Specific Screens from UIKit

UIKit now supports importing and rendering individual screens. This gives you more control over how each screen is used in your app, making it easier to customize user flows and place screens exactly where you need them.

## 📦 Supported Screens

You can import and use the following screens individually in your application:

- [CommunityProfilePage](#)
- [PostDetail](#)
- [UserProfile](#)
- [AmityGlobalFeedComponent](#)
- [AmityExploreComponent](#)

> ✅ Make sure your screen component is wrapped with **`AmityPageRenderer`** at the root level.
>
> ✅ `AmityPageRenderer` is **only required for screen components**. It is **not needed** when using `AmityUiKitSocial`.

### 📝 Component Props

| Component                  | Required Props                                         | Notes                       |

### Component Usage

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import config from './uikit.config.json';
import {
  AmityUiKitProvider,
  AmityUiKitSocial,
  AmityPageRenderer,
  AmityExploreComponent,
  PostDetail,
  CommunityHome,
  UserProfile,
} from 'amity-react-native-social-ui-kit';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AmityUiKitProvider
      configs={config}
      apiKey="API_KEY"
      apiRegion="API_REGION"
      userId="userId"
      displayName="displayName"
    >
      <AmityPageRenderer>
        <CommunityHome defaultCommunityId={'communityID'} />
      </AmityPageRenderer>
    </AmityUiKitProvider>
  );
}
```

### Customization

Our UIKit v4 supports customization in a single place by modifying a `uikit.config.json` file in related UIKit repository. This configuration file includes all necessary data to customize the appearance of each pages, components and elements that we allow to do customization.
Note: uikit.config.json file should be in your project. Please kindly check in example project.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  AmityUiKitSocial,
  AmityUiKitProvider,
} from 'amity-react-native-social-ui-kit';
import config from './uikit.config.json';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AmityUiKitProvider
      configs={config} //put your customized config json object
      apiKey="API_KEY"
      apiRegion="API_REGION"
      userId="userId"
      displayName="displayName"
      apiEndpoint="https://api.{API_REGION}.amity.co"
    >
      <AmityUiKitSocial />
    </AmityUiKitProvider>
  );
}
```

### Using Theme

#### Using the default theme

AmityUIKit uses the default theme as part of the design language.

#### Theme customization

Without customization, the UIKit already looks good. However, if you wish to customize the theme, you can declare changes to color variables by passing your own color codes to our `uikit.config.json`. Here is the code usage of how to customize the theme.

```json
"preferred_theme": "default",
  "theme": {
    "light": {
      "primary_color": "#1054DE",
      "secondary_color": "#292B32",
      "base_color": "#292b32",
      "base_shade1_color": "#636878",
      "base_shade2_color": "#898e9e",
      "base_shade3_color": "#a5a9b5",
      "base_shade4_color": "#ebecef",
      "alert_color": "#FA4D30",
      "background_color": "#FFFFFF"
    },
    "dark": {
      "primary_color": "#1054DE",
      "secondary_color": "#292B32",
      "base_color": "#ebecef",
      "base_shade1_color": "#a5a9b5",
      "base_shade2_color": "#6e7487",
      "base_shade3_color": "#40434e",
      "base_shade4_color": "#292b32",
      "alert_color": "#FA4D30",
      "background_color": "#191919"
    }
  },
```

#### Dark Mode

The Dark Mode feature in our UIKit enhances user experience by providing an alternative visual style that is particularly beneficial in low-light environments. It's designed to reduce eye strain, improve readability, and offer a more visually comfortable interface. You can enable dark mode by just changing `preferred_theme: "default"` to the `preferred_theme: "dark"` in `uikit.config.json`

```js
"preferred_theme": "dark" // change it to dark || light || default,
```

### Documentation

Please refer to our online documentation at https://docs.amity.co or contact a Ui-Kit representative at **clientsolutiomns@amity.co** for support.

### Debugging network traffic

To inspect the sample app's API traffic with Charles Proxy on Android, see
[docs/charles-proxy.md](docs/charles-proxy.md).

```sh
yarn android:charles   # launch the emulator with the Charles proxy set
yarn charles:on        # route a running emulator through Charles
yarn charles:off       # clear it (required — the setting survives a restart)
yarn lan-ip            # print your LAN IP for a physical device's proxy settings
```

## Migration Guide to React Navigation v7

1. Upgrade the following dependencies to the exact versions specified in the `package.json` of UIKit:

   - `@react-navigation/native`: `x.x.x`
   - `@react-navigation/native-stack`: `x.x.x`
   - `@react-navigation/stack`: `x.x.x`
   - `react-native-screens`: `x.x.x`

2. Replace `independent={true}` in `NavigationContainer` with `NavigationIndependentTree`. This ensures proper navigation context isolation for nested navigators.

**Before:**

```tsx
<NavigationContainer independent={true}>
  {/* Your navigators */}
</NavigationContainer>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<NavigationIndependentTree>
  <NavigationContainer>{/* Your navigators */}</NavigationContainer>
</NavigationIndependentTree>
```

Please refer to [full migration guide from official website](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/upgrading-from-6.x) for other breaking changes in your application
